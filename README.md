# my_lib - my code library
Repository for code I use over and over and have written out as functions. This idea was inspired by Adam Pah and Luis Amaral during the NICO Big Data Bootcamp in 2020 (and described in [this blog post](http://www.npcompleteheart.com/posts/i-wish-i-knew-then-what-i-know-now-reproducible-methods-are-awesome/)).
